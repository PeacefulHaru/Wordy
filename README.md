## Security
Our first and the most important goal is to keep your data secret so that no one, even inclduing the developers of Wordy-cloud, are not capable of reading/modifying your data. We follow how the dominating global cloud provider [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free) and use the exactly same encryption method [AES-256](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html) to prevent any security vulnerabilities.

* The following is a sample data; Encrypted data is within 'ciphertextBlob' and each data has its own rule to whom it can be accssed to.

* The communication between your device and our server is protected by the advanced security protocol TLS 1.2.
