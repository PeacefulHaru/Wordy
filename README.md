# Introduction
Wordy-cloud service provides you the best way to become multilingual.
This service is especially for those who have their own professional field and wishing to 
improve their language, yet, they want some management system not to forget important 
terms for your language skills. 

The service tracks and allows you to learn words without having to plan what to review everyday.
You simply try to remember word in front of you, and we will do the back-end work 
to carefully select which words to review.
You won't waste your time which words to study and focus on your field
meanwhile not forgetting any words you have saved in your account at Wordy-cloud.

The developer, I, personally has a field of programming as my profession and has a hobby 
of learning and appreciating languages and culture.
I found myself spending a lot of time trying to choose which words to study first.
I do love languages, but I did not want to spend my time trying to waste time memorizing words.
This service - I also use - helps me focusing on my profession, yet simply review words that the service provides. I found it revolutionary for the multilingual.
