# Project Goal
- This project structure is inspired by AWS infrastructure. Extremely secured feature with security for every layer.
- Databases inclduing EC2, MongoDB, DyanmoDB, S3 and Amazon RDS are located in each prviate or public subnet of AWS for even greater security.
- This project is now moving from Functional Architecture to Event Driven Architecture.
- Planning to move on encryption at rest technology using master key and Wordy CMK.
- Though this project is only for myself, developer, anyone can use it.
- Some of the features such as logging, uploding picures will be denied but you can request it by emailing to me (jkim67cloud@gmail.com)
- Even if you somehow hack the client side of the Wordy-cloud.com, you still can't hack inside because back-end double checks your identity.
- Our server is protected against DDoS attacks thanks to Amazon Shield.
- Our server is checked with Amazon Inspector and Amazon Config.

# Following is purely inspired naming convention from AWS
1. Wambda = Wordy Lambda Functions (AWS Lambda) 
2. wrn = Wordy Resource Name (AWS ARN, amazon resource name)
3. kms = Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
4. cmk = Custom Master Key (AWS KMS's CMK)
5. dek = data encryption key (AWS KMS's DEK)
6. CiphertextBlob (Exactly the same name when you encrypyt data using CMK via AWS CLI)
7. And more

# Version 1.0 Goal
- Credits available
- Credits purchasable using paypal
- Super expandability for any future service (Scrabble and Review Automation)
- Log for everything (disabling works too)
- Event driven feature
- Every data has wrn and owner wrn
- Everything syncs (multi device w/o any sort of problem)
- Absolute one de facto standard data. Master data 
- Data encryption method. 
- Undo is easily done with the seamless integration between front and backend.
- And more.

# Introduction
Wordy-cloud service provides you the best way to become multilingual.
This service is especially for those who have their own professional field and wishing to 
improve their language, yet, they want some management system not to forget important 
terms for your language skills. 

The service tracks and allows you to learn words without having to plan what to review everyday.
You simply try to remember word in front of you, and we will do the back-end work 
to carefully select which words to review.
You won't waste your time which words to study and focus on your field
meanwhile not forgetting any words you have saved in your account at Wordy-cloud.

The developer, I, personally has a field of programming as my profession and has a hobby 
of learning and appreciating languages and culture.
I found myself spending a lot of time trying to choose which words to study first.
I do love languages, but I did not want to spend my time trying to waste time memorizing words.
This service - I also use - helps me focusing on my profession, yet simply review words that the service provides. I found it revolutionary for the multilingual.
